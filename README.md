# Lurch Web Platform, Complex Example Application

Okay, it's not that complex.  A better name might be "second example
application," but since
[the first one](https://github.com/lurchmath/lwp-example-simple)
was called "simple," this one had to be called complex by contrast.
It remains one of the smallest uses of the
[Lurch Web Platform](https://github.com/lurchmath/lurch),
provided as an example for others to imitate/customize when building
applications on the same platform.

Read the (heavily commented) code here:

 * [App code](lwp-example-complex.litcoffee) for this specific example
 * [HTML code](index.html) that loads the platform and application
